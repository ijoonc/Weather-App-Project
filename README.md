# Weather-App-Project

##### This repository contains all the files that are needed to showcase my local Weather App webpage.

##### I integrated HTML and CSS fundamentals to design a weather app webpage that displays a city's current temperature and its weather forecasts. I extracted and processed weather information through the OpenWeatherApp API using JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS, and Axios.
