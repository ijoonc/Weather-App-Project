# Weather App NextJS Template

To use this template, first make sure you have Node installed and then run the following line in your terminal:

```
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/webdevformakers/webdevformakers-basic-template
```

Afterwards, download and transfer files to an IDE (preferably Visual Studio) and run:

``` 
npm run dev
```

This should provide a localhost url that displays the WeatherApp!
