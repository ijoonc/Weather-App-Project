# Weather App NextJS Template

To use this template, first make sure you have Node installed, and then run in your terminal:

```
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/webdevformakers/webdevformakers-basic-template
```

Afterwards, download and transfer files to IDE (Visual Studio) and run npm run dev into terminal
This should give a localhost url which displays the WeatherApp!
